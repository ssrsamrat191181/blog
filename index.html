        <p>Fiverr’s talented new Pro seller offers various Music & Audio services on Fiverr, and he has some great advice to offer new sellers on the platform.</p>
<br>
<h4>What services do you offer on Fiverr Pro?</h4><br>
<p id="intro">I’m offering mixing and mastering,<br> remixing and ghost producing, vocal tuning/mixing, <br>club/festival intro composing and podcast/dialogue audio mixing.</p><br>
<strong>How would you describe your work style and inspiration?</strong><br>
<p>I constantly optimize my workstyle.<br> For me, this process is never ending, whether it means updating templates for a quicker,<br> more efficient workflow, researching new software or improved techniques,<br> and reading about business, communication, and the many aspects of the service industry.<br>
 As for inspiration, I look to mentors and teachers who are top of their game, and learn from them as often as I can.</p><br>
<strong>What tips do you have for other sellers, offering services in your category?</strong><br>
<p>My best advice would be to see everything you do as an experience, from the moment that first message arrives in your inbox, right up until the delivery is accepted, and beyond if a client comes back with a question. What experience are you giving your client, are you going above and beyond, and basically, are you treating them the way you would want to be treated? And specifically, within the music/audio categories, never stop learning. Although you may be a Pro seller, as technological changes are now more rapid than ever, keeping up to date with the latest software and techniques will help keep you ahead of the pack.</p><br>
